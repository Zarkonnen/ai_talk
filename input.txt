AI Generation and Game Development

Parts
- How does it work and how do you use it?
- Legal and moral arguments
- How will it affect game development?
How does it work?
- Vast amounts of data
- Find patterns and correlations
- Reproduce stuff that fits those patterns and correlations
- No ability to do maths and logic
Three tools to try
- ChatGPT
- Midjourney
- GitHub Copilot

Legality
- Models based on data scraped by ignoring copyright
- Copilot previously verbatim reproduced GPL code
Moral Arguments
- Using people's work as raw material to not pay them
- But all art is inspired and remixed
- But corporations tried to kill remixing with copyright maximalism
- "Innovation" that uses tech to disempower workers, like Uber
- But you may have to go with the flow or be outcompeted
The Future
- AI goes in summer/winter cycles, but where are we in the cycle?
- Some indications investors are cooling on AI, bubble may burst
- The current level of tech is already changing things
My Experience
- Portraits for DLC: Midjourney not quite good enough 6 months ago
- Now good enough
- Except it can't do certain things
Midjourney Limitations

Subtle Trap 1: Limits to Creativity
- You adjust your plans based on what you can generate
- What you can generate is based on what's already out there
- You can never break the mold
Subtle Trap 2: Deskilling
- AI is already great at replacing junior/underpaid people
- Senior people still (always?) needed for thinking, creativity
- Can you get senior people if there are no junior jobs?
Projected Outcome
- Big competitive advantage of using AI for rote work
- Near 100% use in mass-market games that use cheap labor right now
- Otherwise, mixture of AI and non-AI use, attempts to differentiate
Longer Term
- Visual quality of games increases
- Creativity decreases
- The rich get richer
- Plus Ã§a change?
But
- You are going to have to wrestle with these questions in the coming years
